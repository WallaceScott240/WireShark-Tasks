# Echoes from the Abyss

This repository contains a mysterious `.pcap` file named `echoes.pcap`. What lies within it is not just traffic — it's a whisper from the void.

## 🕵️‍♂️ Mission

There’s a secret message buried deep in the captured packets.

### How to Discover the Message

1. Load the `echoes.pcap` file in [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/).
2. Follow the TCP streams. Something doesn't look... *normal*.
3. Filter with: `tcp` or `http` and inspect the packet contents.
4. Strings might reveal something. ASCII might whisper it louder.
5. Trust no one. Look closely. Byte by byte. Frame by frame.
6. Maybe there’s more than just data — maybe there’s a *story*.

Happy hunting, investigator. Don’t look too deep — you might not like what you find...
